# Updating-Database-with-Live-API-data
A python project that updates SQL database using live API data written with Google Colaboratory(an enhanced version of Jupyter Notebook)

This framework represents a classic data cycle and is achieved 100% in a cloud and open-source environment.

First, retrieve the input data either from API or python pandas data frame.
Second, load the data to the AWS RDS database to store the data.
Third, visualize the data in the pgAdmin PostgreSQL tool.
Forth, update/insert the new data with the preferred schedule.
